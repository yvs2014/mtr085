MTR

mtr - a network diagnostic tool

SYNOPSIS
--------

**mtr \[-abBcdefFilLmnNopqrsStTuvx46\] HOSTNAME ...**

DESCRIPTION
-----------

**mtr** combines the functionality of the **traceroute** and **ping** programs in a single network diagnostic tool.

As **mtr** starts, it investigates the network connection between the host **mtr** runs on and **HOSTNAME** by sending packets with purposely low TTLs. It continues to send packets with low TTL, noting the response time of the intervening routers. This allows **mtr** to print the response percentage and response times of the internet route to **HOSTNAME**. A sudden increase in packet loss or response time is often an indication of a bad (or simply overloaded) link.

The results are usually reported as round-trip-response times in miliseconds and the percentage of packetloss.
